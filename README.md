Types that help work with an owin environment. Primarily designed to be used by owin middleware and component authors, this is shipped as a dependency free nuget source package.

The types in this project are forked / extracted from [Katana Project's](http://katanaproject.codeplex.com/) Microsoft.Owin. The reason is because it my understanding that Microsoft are focusing on AspNet5 and won't be putting any further time into maintaining these owin types, thus, this fork.
