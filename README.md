LibOwin [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/uvrk7uy2rx99m69n?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/damianh/libowin) [![NuGet Status](http://img.shields.io/nuget/v/LibOwin.svg?style=flat)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/LibLog/)
=====

Types that help work with an owin environment primarily designed to be used internally by owin middleware and component authors. This is shipped as a dependency free nuget source package.

The types in this project are forked / extracted from [Katana Project's](http://katanaproject.codeplex.com/) Microsoft.Owin. It is my understanding that Microsoft are focusing on AspNet5 and won't be putting any further time into maintaining these owin types and given that there are upcoming changes to the owin spec, I've decided to create this project to continue development and maintenance.
